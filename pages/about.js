              Determining an accurate property value requires meticulous
              evaluation of several critical factors that heavily influence
              value: County, neighborhood, zip code, building, sub-market,
              property amenities, physical condition, layout, construction
              quality, square footage, bathrooms, bedrooms, lot size, HOA
              financial condition, and security all play a pivotal role in
              assessing property value with precision.
              <br />
              <br />
              It’s important to avoid improper application of statistical
              measures when forming an opinion of market value. This would be
              akin to using the Dow Jones Industrial Average to determine the
              price of a specific stock in a portfolio.
